# This program provides an interface that allows the user to access and add to a
# student records Database. It also allows the user to encrypt and decrypt the file.
#
# This StudentManagement.py file in particular deals with everything that has to do
# with querying the user, and calling the corresponding functions from other .py files.
#
# A note on code style: Assessment document says to use their function and variable
# names, but it uses CamelCase for function and variable names. This goes against both
# PEP8 and Google Style Guide. Seems weird, but I decided to conform to it with all the
# functions and variables I write in order to stay consistent.
